# visualstudio2019Dll
Demonstrate how to create and use DLL (generated by C++ and C#) in VisualStudio2019.

## Projects

There are several projects which are used to generate dll and clients (which are used to verify dll encryption.).

**Projects which are used to generate DLL:**
1. MathLibraryCPlusPlus: 
- C++.
- 'Dynamic-Link Library (DLL)' project.
2. MathLibraryCSharpDotNet5: 
- C#.
- 'Class library'.
- .NET 5 platform.

**Projects which are used to verify DLL encryption:**
1. TestDll: 
- C# and WPF project, based on .NET 5 platform.
- It uses above two DLL.

## Notes
1. For C++ DLL (**Dynamic-Link Library**), **DllImport** is used. 
2. For C# DLL (**Class library**), **"Add->Project Reference..."** is used.
3. Platform (x86 or x64) shall be matched between DLL file and caller programs.

## Tips

1. Use dumpbin.exe to check .dll file. Pay attention to the platform, x86 or x64. e.g.
- check platform
```
> dumpbin /headers MathLibraryCPlusPlus.dll
```
- check exports
```
> dumpbin /exports MathLibraryCPlusPlus.dll
```

2. Object Browser to check functions in DLL.

3. 'ildasm' to check DLL, which is coded by C# and .Net platform.. It pops up a GUI to show.
```
> ildasm MathLibraryCSharpDotNet5.dll
```
